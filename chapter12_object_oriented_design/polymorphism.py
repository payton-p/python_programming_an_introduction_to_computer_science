# The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but
# different signatures) being used for different types. The key difference is the data types and number of arguments
# used in function.

# Polymorphism with Inheritance:
# In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the
# parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. However, it is possible to
# modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is particularly useful in cases
# where the method inherited from the parent class doesnâ€™t quite fit the child class. In such cases, we re-implement
# the method in the child class. This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as
# Method Overriding.
